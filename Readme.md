Home automation

This is an nodemcu based project I did for automating my room. 
Requirements - 
	nodemcu 
	Relay 5V
	jumper wires
	220v ac to 5v dc convertor

Libraries required - 
	Adafruit esp8266
	Adafruit MQTT library

The program uses two switches  and relay to control devices. 
Extra switches and relays can be attached to the nodemcu
